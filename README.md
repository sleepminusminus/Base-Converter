# Base Converter

This repository contains a suite of tools in different programming languages for converting numbers between different base representations. Several tools exist on the internet for converting single numbers between base representations, but few exist for converting numbers in bulk. Furthermore, the tools that do exist are somewhat inefficient, as they convert to base 10 before converting to other bases.

The ultimate goal will be to create an online site that can be used for quick base representation conversions, and programs in JS, Python, Java, and C++ (or C) for more comprehensive usage.
